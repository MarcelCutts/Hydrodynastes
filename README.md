## Project milestones
Currently working towards the *first milestone*. A more detailed overview can be found on this Trello board.

#### First milestone - Simple single player
Initially the application aims to display a grid, allow you to place a single, one square grid sized vessel, and compete against an AI which utilises random random, but enthusiastic, firing strategies.

#### Second milestone - Ships! Ships! Ships!
Expand the grid to accomodate a variety of ships for the player to place as they choose. Ship names *must* contain serpent flavoured puns.

#### Third milestone - Multiplayer
Allow players to take turns in attempting to sink each others' nest of ships. Requirements include hiding the opposing player's information and choices when the other player takes his or her turn.

##FAQs
#### Why that name?
Hydrodynastes are a form of water snakes. This is a python application about water boats. Previous working title: *Water snake gun boat fighting simulator 2014*.

#### This seems pretty pointless
It absolutely is. A friend is wokring on a similar project and I became curious about how I would tackle this problem.
